Get a fresh look at AngularJS, a "superheroic" framework for building single-page web applications fast. Ray Villalobos shows you how to understand the practical uses of AngularJS with a directory search projectâ€”a traditional type of web app you can add to your existing sites. He defines the MVC architecture underlying AngularJS: the model (your data), views (how data is flowed into your template), and controllers (the JavaScript that links the two together). You then learn how to divide your project into modules; work with services like $http, $routeProvider, and animation; and set up deep linking and navigation. Start now, and learn the simple way to build your own complex web application.
